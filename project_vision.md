# Project Vision

We envision that by the end of the term we will have created a project that provides interesting insights into how geographic locations affect temperature.  We want to see what effects, if any, climate change is having on average temperatures in different countries, different cities, and different lines of latitude. We want to be able to present the data in such a way that it answers our questions while being clear and readable to the audience.  We want to visualize our data clearly and concisely.  

## Contracted Grade
For this project, we agree to contract for a A-.
