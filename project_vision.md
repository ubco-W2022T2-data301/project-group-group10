# Project Vision

We envision that by the end of the term we will have created a project that provides interesting insights into how lifestyle choices affect the amount of medical expenses incurred by certain groups of people in the different area in the US. We want to be able to present the data in such a way that it answers our questions while being clear and readable to the audience. We want to visualize our data clearly and concisely.

## Contracted Grade
